━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

SOLUTION STEPS:

1. Find NFT #37 → Learn riddle "SHIFT NINE PACES FORWARD, WHEN THE PATH ENDS, IT BEGINS ANEW"
   - "Nine paces forward" = shift each letter +9 positions
   - "When the path ends, it begins anew" = alphabet wraps around (Z→A)

2. Find NFT #25 → Get encrypted text "JWBN BXUNRU"

3. Apply Caesar +9 cipher with wrapping:
   Decrypt by shifting BACK 9 positions:

   J(-9)→A, W(-9)→N, B(-9)→S, N(-9)→E, (space),
   B(-9)→S, X(-9)→O, U(-9)→L, N(-9)→E, R(-9)→I, U(-9)→L

   Showing the wrapping:
   - J (10th letter) -9 = A (1st letter)
   - W (23rd letter) -9 = N (14th letter)
   - B (2nd letter) -9 wraps = S (19th letter) [B→A→Z→Y→...→S]
   - X (24th letter) -9 = O (15th letter)
   - R (18th letter) -9 = I (9th letter)
   - U (21st letter) -9 = L (12th letter)

   Result: "ANSE SOLEIL"

4. Find NFT #32 → Map shows Anse Soleil marked on southwest Mahé
5. Find NFT #40 → Coordinates 4.7253° S, 55.4892° E confirm location
6. Google "Anse Soleil Seychelles" → Confirms actual beach location

ABOUT THE LOCATION:

ANSE SOLEIL (meaning "Sun Bay" in French) is a stunning secluded beach
on the southwest coast of Mahé Island, Seychelles.

While not directly documented as a La Buse treasure site, Anse Soleil
represents a realistic alternate cache location because:

- Remote and hidden from main settlements in the 1700s pirate era
- Protected cove ideal for concealing treasure
- Southwest coast position strategic for pirate operations
- Natural harbor features perfect for hiding valuables

The beach is accessed via a winding road through lush tropical forest,
making it one of Mahé's most secluded and beautiful locations - exactly
the type of hidden spot a cunning pirate would choose for a secret cache.

Coordinates: 4.7253° S, 55.4892° E
Location: Southwest coast of Mahé Island, Seychelles
Historical Plausibility: High (remote, protected, accessible by sea)
Current Status: Popular secluded beach destination

This location represents a PLAUSIBLE secondary cache site where La Buse
could have hidden part of his treasure, separate from the main Bel Ombre
excavation site, as pirates often distributed their wealth across
multiple hidden locations for security.

PUZZLE DIFFICULTY:

This puzzle is harder than Chapter 1 because:
1. Caesar +9 is more complex than Caesar +7
2. Multiple letters require alphabet wrapping (B, R, U)
3. The riddle key is cryptic - users must decipher the hint
4. "When the path ends, it begins anew" requires logical thinking
