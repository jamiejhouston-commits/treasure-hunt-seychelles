  "description": "Dawn breaks softly over Cap Ternay, the marine park headlands emerging from calm haze like ancient guardians. A pirate sounder works his lead line with practiced precision, while beside him a witch holds a conch shell to her ear, listening to the sea's secrets. The lead weight bears a stamped '3', and the knotted line reveals the sacred sequence: 3, 5, 8—the Fibonacci numbers that nature herself uses to count. Bearing 158°. Cipher output: CA. \"Hear the sea count in steps of living growth.\"",
