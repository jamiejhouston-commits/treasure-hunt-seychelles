ABOUT THE LOCATION:

BEL OMBRE is the ACTUAL historical site of the La Buse treasure hunt!

In 1923, Rose Savouy discovered mysterious rock carvings here including
symbols of a dog, snake, horse, turtle, hearts, and human figures -
believed to be treasure markers left by Olivier Levasseur (La Buse).

The Cruise-Wilkins family has excavated at Bel Ombre since 1948,
following clues from La Buse's cryptogram. The site contains tunnels,
carved rocks, and structures that may lead to treasure worth $200+ million.

Coordinates: 4.6167° S, 55.4167° E
Location: Northwest coast of Mahé Island, Seychelles
Historical Significance: Primary La Buse treasure excavation site
Current Status: Active treasure hunting continues today

This location represents the REAL epicenter of the La Buse treasure
legend, where actual treasure hunters have searched for decades based
on authentic historical documents and physical evidence.
