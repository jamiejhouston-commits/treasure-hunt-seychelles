  "name": "Anse Major: House of Smoke",
  "description": "The ruined house above Anse Major wheezes char and molasses; nine curls of soot-smoke knot into a skull, two nailed leather straps creak beneath a splintered step, and seven scorched letters pulse ember-orange across the lintel. Naia keeps sketching even as gusts drive ash into her eyes, Kassim shoulders the door and coughs blood-tinged sputum, and Maliya draws sigils in soot that smear back as if licked by tongues. The shard in Kassim's satchel thrums when the 110° breeze knifes through the broken windows.",
